## Frame 7 — The answer streams in

- scene: The real answer card; the answer reveals like a stream — the highlighted key line ("Yeah, my capstone project, ShelfLife…") then the bullets — and a "built from" pill names the two files.
- voiceover: "And your answer streams in. The key line highlighted, talking points from your own CV underneath."

- focal: assets/answer-ready.jpg
- roles: answer-ready = hero surface (answer card crop)
- asset_candidates: assets/answer-ready.jpg — deadline answer at the top of Answers with highlighted key line, 4 CV-based bullets, "first words in 1.0s"

narrativeRole: The payoff of the demo cycle and of Frame 3 — ShelfLife, the two-week deadline and the award all come from the sample CV.
keyMessage: A usable answer, grounded in your own experience.

Adapt: keep the cause→effect journey (the question at the top of the card is the cause; the camera lands on the payoff); change: the consequence is the answer text revealing in place as a stream, with only a short early camera settle.
Scene 1 (0.0–1.8s): the card is in place with only its question line + "first words in 1.0s" visible; a short early settle (slight scale-down to rest) → `multi-phase-camera`; on "your answer streams in", the highlighted key line unmasks left→right line by line like streaming text, a small dark caret riding the reveal edge → `dynamic-content-sequencing` (+ `context-sensitive-cursor`).
Scene 2 (1.8–3.2s): on "The key line highlighted", the key line's yellow highlight gets a brief brightness lift (a one-time pass, not a glow).
Scene 3 (3.2–5.2s): on "talking points from your own CV", the four bullets unmask one after another top→down → `dynamic-content-sequencing`; on "your own CV", the "built from Sam Rivera CV + Northwind Labs job post" pill slides up below the card → `gsap-effects`.
Scene 4 (5.2–6.6s): hold still on the full answer.

## Selected blueprint: camera-journey

# camera-journey — Camera Journey

**intent**: The real viewport camera is the STORYTELLER — a multi-leg journey (dive in → a mid-journey beat fires → travel to the consequence / reposition → landing push, at rest) across ONE continuous world, where the travel itself carries the narrative. Two folded sub-shapes: **(A) action roundtrip** — the camera dives into a UI panel, a cursor/typed action fires, and the camera swoops/pans to another region where the consequence renders as element motion; **(B) cursorless flight** — pure cinematic 3D flight (motion blur, depth-of-field, tilt-to-flatten rotations) over static or self-animating content, no cursor anywhere.

**boundary**: This is NOT `cursor-ui-demo` — there the camera _chases_ the cursor (a servo following the actor); here the camera IS the actor, moving on its own narrative motivation, and in sub-shape A the cursor acts only at the leg hinge (in B it never appears). This is NOT `device-surface-showcase` — there one DEVICE/surface is hero and the camera merely presents it; here no single surface is hero — the journey traverses multiple regions/panels/depth planes and the traversal is the story. This is NOT `spatial-pan-stations` — there pre-placed stations on a flat canvas are visited by repeated pans of the same type; here the legs are heterogeneous (push-in, swoop, pull-back-rotate, whip, dive) and each leg is _motivated_ (by a fired action, or by the reveal it lands on).

**roles served**

- Benefits (from `camera-swoop-panel-action-roundtrip`): when the benefit IS a cause→effect round trip — "do this small thing here, get this big thing there" (comment → chart morphs; agent finding → verified commit; chat message → receipt + ledger). The camera physically connects the action to its payoff, so the viewer _travels_ the value chain instead of being told it.
- Key_Feature (from `cursorless-camera-flight`): when the feature should feel cinematic and inevitable — a payout form or a generated content-plan calendar explored by a flying camera (dives, whip sweeps, tilt-to-flatten, violent final push onto the CTA/hero card), the content acting by itself (a dropdown self-selects; keyword cards simply exist in depth) with no hand on the wheel.

**duration**: 5.6–11.1s (sub-shape A 5.6–9.0s: 001 5.6s · 066 8.6s · 004 9.0s; sub-shape B 6.3–11.1s: Outrank 6.3s · 094 11.1s)

**shot structure** (one oversized `[world]` — a `[UI canvas: design tool / GitHub + agent panels / phone + desktop ledger]` (A) or a `[3D-laid-out space: floating form card / calendar grid with standing keyword cards]` (B) — wrapped by a single virtual camera; content animates as elements _inside_ the world while the camera travels; every leg is a sequential tween on the same camera state)

- **Scene 0 (optional, 0.0–~1.8s) — static prologue.** Camera locked on a `[prologue beat: static promo card with a floating 3D product card / typed headline with an accent word / wide establishing shot of the app]`. A typewriter line may finish (`[headline]` types on, accent word in `[accent color]`). The prologue BREAKS by a hard cut or by the headline shrinking and slipping away as the first dive begins — the stillness exists to make the journey's launch land.

- **Scene 1 (~0.5–2.0s) — LEG 1: dive in.** The camera pushes in FAST and TIGHT onto `[the focal element]`:
  - _Sub-shape A_: a flat whole-viewport push onto `[an actionable element: comment box / agent panel / chat bubble]` where `[typed text]` finishes typing or `[response text]` streams in. The header/context leaves the frame — commitment, not a polite zoom.
  - _Sub-shape B_: the push lands at an ANGLE — a tilted 3D close-up of `[the form region / the calendar grid]`, foreground elements motion-blurred during the travel, neighbors soft under depth-of-field. A huge `[foreground prop: date number / field label]` may dominate the frame, blurred by speed.

- **Scene 2 (~1.5–6.0s) — LEG 2: the mid-journey beat (the hinge).** The camera holds, drifts, or pulls slowly while the content ACTS:
  - _Sub-shape A — the action fires_: a `[cursor]` clicks `[Send / Create PR]` (or a `[message]` sends implicitly) and the acted element CLEARS/vanishes. Optional theater before the click: a `[status spinner]` cycles `[status words]`, `[to-do items]` strike through, `[response text]` streams. The click is the hinge that _motivates_ the next leg.
  - _Sub-shape B — the content self-acts_: a `[dropdown]` expands by itself (pushing `[the field below]` down), shows a `[row hover highlight]` with no cursor, and collapses with the new value selected; OR the flight decelerates INTO FOCUS on `[one card]` — its `[metrics]` sharp, neighboring cards blurred.

- **Scene 3 (~4.0–8.0s) — LEG 3: travel to the consequence / reposition.**
  - _Sub-shape A_: the camera pulls back / swoops / pans to `[region B]` while the CONSEQUENCE builds as element motion — `[bars shrink into the baseline while a node-dotted line draws left→right / a verified commit row slides into the timeline + a reaction pill pops / a receipt card expands row-by-row from a skeleton]`. An optional SECOND leg extends the trip: `[pan up-right to a toolbar → a dropdown cascades open / match cut into an extreme close-up → a fast decelerating zoom-out reveals a ledger table]`.
  - _Sub-shape B_: a repositioning move — a slow pull-back that ROTATES the world flat and centered (3D → straight-on 2D), or a heavily motion-blurred WHIP SWEEP that resolves into a flat lateral pan across `[a month calendar / the full card]`. On the flat hold, quiet element beats may play: a thin `[focus outline]` fades in around one `[field]` and sweeps down to the next; the card keeps a near-imperceptible tilt/scale drift so the hold never dies.

- **Scene 4 (final ~1–2s) — LEG 4: landing.** The journey resolves on the payoff:
  - _Sub-shape A_: the camera comes to REST; the `[cursor]` hovers or drifts toward `[the payoff: an open Export menu item / the commit link / the View-transaction button]`; ends still, on the changed state — the world is visibly different from where the trip began.
  - _Sub-shape B_: a sudden VIOLENT push-in/dive (motion-blurred) onto `[the CTA button scaled huge in frame / the hero keyword card]`, ending holding tight — or holding MID-DIVE (the last frames are still traveling; the flat overview is explicitly not the final image).

**motion vocabulary**: whole-viewport camera push-in (fast/tight and slow/subtle); camera pull-back reframe; camera pan up/right/down; dive/swoop between stacked panels; fast decelerating zoom-out to rest; sudden violent push-in onto a button scaled huge; continuous 3D flight through a card grid; dive into an angled 3D close-up; slow pull-back that rotates/flattens the world to straight-on; heavily motion-blurred whip sweep; motion blur on camera travel; depth-of-field with blurred neighbors; decelerate-into-focus; hard cut / match cut into extreme close-up; near-imperceptible tilt/scale drift on holds; typed text finishing in an input; typewriter headline; headline shrinks and slips away as the camera dives; streaming AI response text; status-word spinner cycling labels; to-do strikethrough draw; cursor click; clicked element clears/vanishes; dropdown cascades open / self-expands and collapses with a row hover highlight (displacing the field below); bar-to-line chart morph (bars shrink into the baseline while a node-dotted line draws left→right, labels persist); commit row slide-in on a timeline; reaction pill appears; skeleton→content card build; receipt/label rows expand row-by-row; thin focus outline fades in and sweeps between fields; camera drift toward a button; 3D card subtle float; cursor hover at rest.

**rule mapping**

- the multi-leg camera itself — sequential push / pull-back / pan / dive phases on one wrapper, plus the micro-drift that keeps holds alive → `multi-phase-camera` (phase sequencing + drift) over `viewport-change` (the base virtual-camera primitive: single `.world` wrapper, one `cam {scale,x,y}` state — one source of truth for every leg)
- diving TIGHT onto an off-center element (comment box, chat bubble, Send button, one keyword card) → `coordinate-target-zoom` (scale + counter-translate; measure the target, don't hand-derive — a journey amplifies centering error on every leg)
- fast decelerating zoom-out from an extreme close-up to rest (066's ledger reveal) → `coordinate-target-zoom` zoom-out variation / `multi-phase-camera` (pull phase, hard `power4.out`)
- motion blur on camera travel (dive, whip sweep, violent final push) → `motion-blur-streak` (Camera-travel carve-out — the blur envelope rides the `.world` wrapper during a leg: the world never leaves frame, the blur peaks at peak velocity and resolves sharp at each landing)
- depth-of-field on neighbors while one card is in focus; decelerate-into-focus → `depth-of-field-blur` (focal pull + blur-the-cluster-while-pushing-in are explicitly in scope; run the DoF tween at the same position as the camera leg)
- the 3D flight itself (sub-shape B's core) — a perspective camera traveling with `rotateX/rotateY/translateZ` through a 3D-laid-out world: the dive into an angled calendar grid, the tilt-to-flatten pull-back (angled 3D → straight-on 2D), the continuous flight between standing cards → `3d-camera-flight` (perspective wrapper + preserve-3d; the 2D camera rules keep owning any flat legs)
- whip sweep → composition: `nudge-curve` (burst-dominant tuning of the slow-fast-slow slide, applied to the world) + `motion-blur-streak` (camera-travel carve-out) on the same window
- typed text finishing in an input; typewriter headline; streaming AI response text; status spinner cycling `[status words]`; skeleton→content state swap → `discrete-text-sequence` (+ `gsap-effects` typewriter; `context-sensitive-cursor` for the input caret)
- which content appears per leg / receipt rows and findings arriving on script windows → `dynamic-content-sequencing`
- cursor click on `[Send / Create PR]` (sub-shape A's hinge) → `cursor-click-ripple` + `press-release-spring` (or `physics-press-reaction` for a weightier press)
- clicked element clears/vanishes; panel state A → B on the return leg → `scale-swap-transition` / `card-morph-anchor`
- to-do strikethrough draw; row hover highlight → `css-marker-patterns` (strike-through) · `asr-keyword-glow` (accent glow on the hovered/selected row)
- bar-to-line chart morph → composite, decomposes cleanly: `stat-bars-and-fills` (bars `scaleY` → baseline) + `svg-path-draw` (node-dotted line draws left→right) at the same timeline position — no single rule names the coordinated chart-type morph, but no new rule needed
- commit row slide-in; reaction pill appears; receipt rows expand row-by-row → `spring-pop-entrance` (single arrivals) / `waterfall-entry` (the row-by-row cascade)
- dropdown self-expands, displacing the field below (094) → `anchored-layout-expand` (the masked edge-anchored expansion of the dropdown body — never tween `height`) + `reactive-displacement` (the expansion tween drives the sibling's displacement)
- focus-ring travel between fields (094: a thin outline fades in on `From`, then sweeps down onto `Amount`) → `ai-tracking-box` restyled as a plain outline (offsets baked at setup; size morphed via scale, never width/height)
- 3D card subtle float; near-imperceptible tilt/scale drift on holds → `sine-wave-loop` (+ `multi-phase-camera`'s drift for the camera-side micro-motion; the _tilt_ component of the drift belongs to `3d-camera-flight`)
- camera drift toward a button; slow subtle zoom-ins riding a hold → `multi-phase-camera` (steady-push mode, tiny spread)

**camera grammar** (the defining layer — this blueprint IS its camera): every leg is a tween on ONE camera state (`viewport-change`'s single `.world` wrapper / `cam` object), sequenced by `multi-phase-camera`, aimed by `coordinate-target-zoom`. Legs must be _motivated_: sub-shape A moves because an action fired (click → swoop to the consequence); sub-shape B moves because the next reveal demands it (dive → focus → reposition → final dive). Vary the leg verbs — a journey of four identical pushes reads as a slideshow. Ease law: hard `out`-family on dives and landings (`power4.out` — violent arrival, sharp settle), `power2.inOut` on repositioning legs; spring/back easing on a camera feels wrong (per `multi-phase-camera`). Sub-shape B layers `3d-camera-flight`'s perspective wrapper under the same single-state discipline.

**Seek-safety (non-negotiable for this much camera):** the entire journey — every leg, every blur envelope, every DoF pull — lives on the ONE paused GSAP timeline, so any frame seek reproduces the exact mid-leg camera pose. One camera state object, transform composed in a single writer (`applyCamera()`), no CSS `transition` anywhere near the wrapper, blur via proxy-tweened attributes / `--dof` vars (both seek-safe), and ending mid-dive is fine — a seek to the last frame just lands mid-tween. Per-leg targets are measured ONCE at setup (after `fonts.ready`) and baked; never `getBoundingClientRect` in `onUpdate`.

**Overflow (required for a clean `check`):** a traveling camera deliberately moves world content past the frame edges on every leg. Keep `overflow: hidden` on the scene root AND mark the moving `.world` wrapper with `data-layout-allow-overflow` — otherwise `check` reports `text_box_overflow` / `container_overflow` for every panel the journey leaves behind (see the same note on `device-surface-showcase`).

## Selected motion rule: context-sensitive-cursor

# Context-Sensitive Cursor

In a typewriter sequence, the cursor's color (and optionally height / blink behavior) matches the **active text segment** — brand accent while typing the brand name, dim on placeholders, success color on the completion mark. The eye lands on the keyword being typed because the cursor shifts with it; a fixed single-color cursor is visual noise by comparison. Layers on top of [discrete-text-sequence](discrete-text-sequence.md)'s SEQUENCE pattern.

## How It Works

The text is authored as a SEQUENCE of `{ t, text, segment, color }` entries; a linear driver's `onUpdate` reverse-searches for the current entry and writes both the visible text and the cursor's `background` (the cursor is a colored block, so `background`, NOT `color`). A second linear tween sweeps a phase `p` through `2π × BLINK_CYCLES_PER_SCENE` and gates cursor opacity on `sin(p) > 0` — a deterministic square-wave blink on the timeline.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="prompt">$</div>
  <div class="text-wrap">
    <span class="text" id="text"></span><span class="cursor" id="cursor">_</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.terminal {
  font-family: {monoFont}; /* proportional fonts drift the cursor mid-segment */
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  white-space: pre; /* preserve trailing spaces — cursor sits at segment end */
}
.text {
  white-space: pre;
}
.cursor {
  display: inline-block; /* inline ignores width/height */
  width: {cursorWidth}px;
  height: {cursorHeight}px;
  background: {textColor}; /* default — overridden per segment in onUpdate */
  vertical-align: {cursorBaselineFix}px; /* small negative — anchor to baseline, not line-height */
}
```

```js
// Adjacent entries usually share a text prefix but may differ in `segment` —
// that's what shifts the cursor color mid-line.
const SEQUENCE = [
  { t: 0, text: "", segment: "main", color: "{mainColor}" },
  { t: T_LEADIN_END, text: "{leadInChunk}", segment: "main", color: "{mainColor}" },
  { t: T_BRAND_IN, text: "{leadInBrandPrefix}", segment: "brand", color: "{brandColor}" },
  { t: T_BRAND_OUT, text: "{leadInBrandFull}", segment: "main", color: "{mainColor}" },
  { t: T_CMD_IN, text: "{leadInCmdPrefix}", segment: "cmd", color: "{cmdColor}" },
  { t: T_SUCCESS, text: "{leadInDone}", segment: "success", color: "{successColor}" },
];

function entryAt(time) {
  for (let i = SEQUENCE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= SEQUENCE[i].t) return SEQUENCE[i];
  }
  return SEQUENCE[0];
}

const textEl = document.getElementById("text");
const cursorEl = document.getElementById("cursor");

const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: DURATION,
    duration: DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const entry = entryAt(driver.t);
      textEl.textContent = entry.text;
      cursorEl.style.background = entry.color;
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Deterministic square-wave blink
const blink = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  blink,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BLINK_CYCLES_PER_SCENE,
    duration: DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      cursorEl.style.opacity = Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Non-blinking during active typing** — suppress blink while letters are appearing (solid cursor), resume on idle. This MUST be a pure function of the driver's time: tracking a mutable `lastChangeTime` in `onUpdate` is not reverse-seek-safe (scrubbing backwards leaves the stale forward-pass value behind and the cursor blinks — or holds solid — at the wrong frames). Bake the change times from the SEQUENCE instead — every entry whose `text` differs from its predecessor is a typing event:

```js
// Baked once at build time — no runtime state.
const CHANGE_TIMES = SEQUENCE.filter((e, i) => i > 0 && e.text !== SEQUENCE[i - 1].text).map(
  (e) => e.t,
);
// In onUpdate — identical result at any seek, either direction:
const isTyping = CHANGE_TIMES.some((t) => t <= driver.t && driver.t - t < TYPING_GRACE);
cursorEl.style.opacity = isTyping ? "1" : Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
```

- **Cursor HEIGHT shifts on segment** — larger cursor on the brand segment: `cursorEl.style.height = entry.segment === "brand" ? cursorHeightEmphasis : cursorHeight` (1.1–1.25×; more reads as glitch).
- **Contrast reversal** — a dark-text-on-light segment needs a dark cursor too; keep `entry.color` as the single source of truth and read from it.

## Values

| token                  | range                       | notes                                                                                           |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DURATION               | 4–8s per typed line         | `≥ SEQUENCE[last].t + closing dwell`                                                            |
| entry `t` spacing      | 0.2–0.5s micro-additions    | ascending, non-uniform — slow down on highlights                                                |
| segment palette        | 3–4 colors max              | more reads as random; brand vs success should differ in saturation/luminance                    |
| cursorWidth / Height   | 8–24px / 0.85–1.0× fontSize | too thin vanishes in render compression; too tall outranks the text                             |
| cursorBaselineFix      | small negative px           | drop the block to the text baseline                                                             |
| BLINK_CYCLES_PER_SCENE | period ≈ 0.6–1.2s           | **whole number** — otherwise the sin sweep ends mid-cycle and the cursor pops on the last frame |
| TYPING_GRACE           | 0.15–0.3s                   | **< shortest dwell between adjacent entries** — otherwise the cursor never blinks               |

## Critical Constraints

- **Cursor color goes on `background`** — it's a colored block, not a glyph.
- **Blink is timeline-driven sin, pure of any mutable tracker** — the typing-grace variation shows the seek-safe form.
- **`white-space: pre` on text and container** — collapsed trailing spaces park the cursor in the wrong column.
- **Monospace font + `display: inline-block` cursor** — proportional faces drift the cursor mid-segment; inline ignores the block geometry.
- **BLINK_CYCLES_PER_SCENE is a whole number** for the fixed DURATION.

description: Auto-calculate timeline start/end times from content length + per-item duration config — longer content gets more screen time without hardcoded numbers.
metadata:
  tags: timeline, sequencing, dynamic, duration, content-aware, utility

# Dynamic Content Sequencing

A utility pattern (not a motion rule in itself) for scenes that show a SEQUENCE of items (cards, phrases, stats): each item's duration is computed from its content length + per-item config, and the sequencer assigns absolute start/end times automatically — no hardcoded offsets per item. Distinct from [discrete-text-sequence](discrete-text-sequence.md) (one text element changing states) — this rule swaps between distinct content blocks.

## How It Works

A content array of `{ eyebrow, title, body, speedFactor, hold }` entries is reduced once at build time into a flat `TIMELINE` of `{ …entry, start, end }` — duration per entry is `BASE_DURATION + body.length × SEC_PER_CHAR + hold`, so longer text earns more reading time. A single linear driver's `onUpdate` reverse-searches the active entry and swaps the DOM **only on transitions** (a `lastTitle` guard — per-frame `textContent` writes flicker in render); an optional progress bar fills 0→100% across the whole run.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="display">
  <div class="eyebrow" id="eyebrow"></div>
  <div class="title" id="title"></div>
  <div class="body" id="body"></div>
  <div class="progress-bar"><div class="progress-fill" id="progress-fill"></div></div>
</div>
```

```css
.body {
  min-height: 160px; /* reserve space — content height varies; without this, layout jumps */
}
.progress-fill {
  height: 100%;
  width: 0%;
}
```

```js
// N entries, each with its own pacing (optionally a speedFactor multiplier);
// the final entry uses a larger hold (closing beat).
const CONTENT = [
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrow1}", title: "{title1}", body: "{body1}", hold: HOLD_MID },
  // …
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrowN}", title: "{titleN}", body: "{bodyN}", hold: HOLD_FINAL },
];

// Pre-compute absolute start/end ONCE — never in onUpdate.
let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry) => {
  const dur = BASE_DURATION + entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR + entry.hold;
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});

function entryAt(time) {
  for (let i = TIMELINE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= TIMELINE[i].start) return TIMELINE[i];
  }
  return TIMELINE[0];
}

const eyebrowEl = document.getElementById("eyebrow");
const titleEl = document.getElementById("title");
const bodyEl = document.getElementById("body");
const progressEl = document.getElementById("progress-fill");

const TOTAL_DURATION = cumulative + TAIL_PAD;
const driver = { t: 0 };
let lastTitle = "";

tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const entry = entryAt(driver.t);
      // Swap content only on transitions — no per-frame DOM thrash
      if (entry.title !== lastTitle) {
        eyebrowEl.textContent = entry.eyebrow;
        titleEl.textContent = entry.title;
        bodyEl.textContent = entry.body;
        lastTitle = entry.title;
      }
      progressEl.style.width = `${(driver.t / TOTAL_DURATION) * 100}%`;
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Crossfade between items** — return BOTH adjacent entries during an overlap window (`time ≥ e.start − overlap && time ≤ e.end + overlap`, overlap ≈ 0.3s) and render them with opacities computed from distance to the boundary.
- **Per-item motion variation** — map an `entry.style` key to an existing rule per chapter (e.g. `3d-text-depth-layers` → `hacker-flip-3d` → `counting-dynamic-scale`); the sequencer only orchestrates timing.
- **Auto-extend composition duration** — you can set `data-duration` from the computed `TOTAL_DURATION` in script, but HF reads `data-duration` at composition load and setting it after init may not take effect — author the duration manually from a rough total.

### Accelerating cadence (geometric hold decay)

For rhetorical escalation — "everyone says…", a roll-call, a praise flurry — the beat grid itself accelerates: early entries hold ~1s (read speed), then windows shrink geometrically into a ~0.15–0.3s flurry, braking on an emphasis state before the resolve. The acceleration is pre-computed into the same flat `TIMELINE` — still content-driven, still deterministic, no speed-up tween anywhere:

```js
// Geometric decay on the hold, clamped at a flurry floor; the brake state holds longest.
const HOLDS = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => Math.max(FLURRY_FLOOR, HOLD_START * Math.pow(DECAY, i)));
HOLDS[CONTENT.length - 1] = HOLD_FINAL;

let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => {
  // Past ~0.5s states are glanced as motion texture, not read —
  // drop the per-char term or you never reach flurry speed.
  const readable = HOLDS[i] >= READ_THRESHOLD;
  const dur = HOLDS[i] + (readable ? entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR : 0);
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});
```

Worked example — **praise-chip flurry**: ~16 short quotes hard-cut through a chip beside a pinned wordmark. First 3 states at `HOLD_START = 1.0` (each reads fully); `DECAY = 0.8` shrinks every following window until `FLURRY_FLOOR = 0.2` catches it (≈12 states over ~2.5s — a churn of acclaim, individually glanced); the longest phrase takes `HOLD_FINAL ≈ 1.6` as the brake before the closing lockup.

Values: `HOLD_START` 0.8–1.2s; `DECAY` 0.75–0.88 (higher = longer runway before the flurry bites); `FLURRY_FLOOR` 0.15–0.3s (below ~0.15s swaps strobe); `READ_THRESHOLD` ~0.5s; brake ≥ 4× the floor or the stop doesn't register as a beat. The 3–6 entry guidance relaxes here — 12–18 states are legal precisely because flurry states aren't individually read. The hard-cut discipline (`lastTitle` guard, instant swaps) is what lets 0.2s states render clean.

## Values

| token         | range                 | notes                                                                                                                 |
| ------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BASE_DURATION | 0.6–1.5s              | minimum per entry regardless of length — even one-word entries get read time                                          |
| SEC_PER_CHAR  | 0.03–0.06 s/char      | ≈17–33 chars/sec; uniform across the sequence so the pace reads as one engine; lean high for wide-character languages |
| HOLD_MID      | 0.5–1.0s              | dwell on a non-final entry; `< HOLD_FINAL`                                                                            |
| HOLD_FINAL    | 1.0–2.0s              | climax dwell — must exceed HOLD_MID by a clear margin so the close reads as a beat                                    |
| SPEED_FACTOR  | 0.5–2.0 (default 1.0) | per-entry only; if every entry shares a factor, fold it into SEC_PER_CHAR                                             |
| TAIL_PAD      | 0.0–1.0s              | quiet beat after the last entry; prefer 0 when the next composition owns the breath                                   |
| CONTENT N     | 3–6 entries           | <3 isn't a sequence; >6 drags (accelerating cadence relaxes this — see above)                                         |

## Critical Constraints

- **Pre-compute the TIMELINE once at build** — never recompute in `onUpdate`; the reverse search over the flat array is the whole per-frame cost.
- **DOM swap only on entry transition** (`lastTitle`/key guard) — per-frame `textContent` assignment flickers in HF render.
- **`min-height` on the body element** — without reservation, downstream elements (progress bar, brand) jitter as content height varies.
- **Sequential only** — for parallel tracks use a different reduction.
- **Titles fit one line at the chosen size; bodies fit inside `min-height` after wrapping.**

# GSAP Effects for HyperFrames

Drop-in animation patterns. Snippets show mechanism only, inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core); assume `tl` exists.

- [Typewriter](#typewriter) — character-by-character reveal with optional cursor / backspace / word rotation
- [Audio Visualizer](#audio-visualizer) — pre-extract audio data, drive Canvas/DOM rendering from the timeline

## Typewriter

Requires GSAP's TextPlugin alongside the core script:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gsap@3.14.2/dist/TextPlugin.min.js"></script>
<script>
  gsap.registerPlugin(TextPlugin);
</script>
```

### Basic

```js
const text = "Hello, world!";
const cps = 10; // chars per second — see timing table
tl.to(
  "#typed-text",
  { text: { value: text }, duration: text.length / cps, ease: "none" },
  startTime,
);
```

### Blinking Cursor

Three rules: **one cursor visible at a time** (hide previous before showing next); **cursor must blink when idle** (after typing, during holds); **no gap between text and cursor** (elements flush in HTML).

```html
<span id="typed-text"></span><span id="cursor" class="cursor-blink">|</span>
```

```css
@keyframes blink {
  0%,
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
  }
  50% {
    opacity: 0;
  }
}
.cursor-blink {
  animation: blink 0.8s step-end infinite;
}
.cursor-solid {
  animation: none;
  opacity: 1;
}
.cursor-hide {
  animation: none;
  opacity: 0;
}
```

Pattern: blink → solid (typing starts) → type → blink (typing done):

```js
tl.call(() => cursor.classList.replace("cursor-blink", "cursor-solid"), [], startTime);
tl.to("#typed-text", { text: { value: text }, duration: dur, ease: "none" }, startTime);
tl.call(() => cursor.classList.replace("cursor-solid", "cursor-blink"), [], startTime + dur);
```

Multi-line handoff: hide previous cursor → blink new → brief pause (~0.5s) → solid when typing. Never go `hidden → solid` (skips the idle blink).

### Backspacing

TextPlugin removes from the front — wrong for backspace. Use manual substring removal:

```js
function backspace(tl, selector, word, startTime, cps) {
  const el = document.querySelector(selector);
  const interval = 1 / cps;
  for (let i = word.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    tl.call(
      () => (el.textContent = word.slice(0, i)),
      [],
      startTime + (word.length - i) * interval,
    );
  }
  return word.length * interval;
}
```

### Spacing With Static Text

A typewriter word next to static text (`<span>Ship something</span><span style="margin-left:14px"><span id="word"></span><span id="cursor">|</span></span>` in a baseline-aligned flex row): use `margin-left` on the wrapper span. Don't use flex `gap` (it spaces the cursor from the text) and don't put a trailing space in the static text (it collapses when the dynamic span is empty).

### Word Rotation

Type → hold → backspace → next word; cursor blinks during every idle moment:

```js
let offset = 0;
words.forEach((word, i) => {
  const typeDur = word.length / 10;
  // cursor: solid while typing, blink during holds (same call pattern as above)
  tl.to("#typed-text", { text: { value: word }, duration: typeDur, ease: "none" }, offset);
  offset += typeDur + 1.5; // hold
  if (i < words.length - 1) offset += backspace(tl, "#typed-text", word, offset, 20) + 0.3;
});
```

### Appending Words

Build a sentence word-by-word into the same element: keep an `accumulated` string, each step tweens `text: { value: accumulated + " " + word }` with `duration: newChars / cps`, then advances the offset.

### Timing Guide

| CPS   | Feel             | Good for                   |
| ----- | ---------------- | -------------------------- |
| 3-5   | Slow, deliberate | Dramatic reveals, suspense |
| 8-12  | Natural typing   | Dialogue, narration        |
| 15-20 | Fast, energetic  | Tech demos, code           |
| 30+   | Near-instant     | Filling long blocks        |

## Audio Visualizer

Pre-extract audio data, drive Canvas / DOM rendering from the timeline. **Do not use the Web Audio API at render time** — there's no playback during seek.

### Extract Audio Data

Bundled extractor (requires `ffmpeg` + Python `numpy`):

```bash
python skills/hyperframes-creative/scripts/extract-audio-data.py audio.mp3 -o audio-data.json
python skills/hyperframes-creative/scripts/extract-audio-data.py video.mp4 --fps 30 --bands 16 -o audio-data.json
```

Output: `{ "fps": 30, "totalFrames": 5415, "frames": [{ "time": 0.0, "rms": 0.42, "bands": [0.8, 0.6, 0.3] }] }` — `rms` (0-1) is overall loudness; `bands[]` (0-1) are frequency magnitudes, index 0 = bass, each band normalized independently.

### Loading (Synchronously)

Inline the JSON for small files (< ~500 KB), or sync XHR for large ones:

```js
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.open("GET", "audio-data.json", false); // synchronous — deliberate
xhr.send();
const AUDIO_DATA = JSON.parse(xhr.responseText);
```

**Do NOT use async `fetch()`** — HyperFrames reads `window.__timelines` synchronously after page load; building the timeline inside `.then()` means it isn't ready when capture starts.

### Driving the Timeline

Canvas 2D is the workhorse (bars, waveforms, circles, gradients) — one `tl.call` per frame:

```js
const ctx = document.getElementById("viz").getContext("2d");
for (let f = 0; f < AUDIO_DATA.totalFrames; f++) {
  tl.call(
    () => {
      const frame = AUDIO_DATA.frames[f];
      ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
      // draw using frame.rms and frame.bands
    },
    [],
    f / AUDIO_DATA.fps,
  );
}
```

WebGL / Three.js: HyperFrames patches `THREE.Clock` for deterministic time — update uniforms from audio data each frame. DOM elements: fine under ~20 elements, slower than Canvas beyond that.

### Smoothing

```js
let prev = null;
const smoothing = 0.25; // 0.1-0.2 snappy, 0.3-0.5 flowing
function smooth(f) {
  const raw = AUDIO_DATA.frames[f];
  if (!prev) prev = { rms: raw.rms, bands: [...raw.bands] };
  else {
    prev = {
      rms: prev.rms * smoothing + raw.rms * (1 - smoothing),
      bands: raw.bands.map((b, i) => prev.bands[i] * smoothing + b * (1 - smoothing)),
    };
  }
  return prev;
}
```

### Design Guide

- **Spatial mapping** — horizontal: bass left, treble right; vertical: bass bottom; circular: bass at 12 o'clock, wrap clockwise (mirror for a full circle).
- **Bass drives big moves** (scale, glow, position); **treble drives detail** (shimmer, flicker, edges); **RMS drives globals** (background brightness, overall energy).
- Pick 2-3 animated properties — more looks noisy. Keep minimums above zero so quiet sections still have life.
- **Band count**: 4 = background glow/pulse, 8 = bar charts, 16 = detailed EQ (default), 32 = dense radial layouts.
- **Layering**: stack canvases with `z-index` — a background layer driven by bass/rms under a foreground layer driven by individual bands gives depth without per-element complexity.

# Multi-Phase Camera

A camera wrapper around the ENTIRE scene that progresses through discrete zoom phases at scripted triggers, with continuous sine-driven micro-drift overlaid so the camera never feels static between phases. Distinct from a single linear zoom — multi-phase creates cinematic pacing (anticipation → reveal → settle).

## How It Works

The camera is one wrapping `<div>` whose `transform: scale() translate(x, y)` is composed from two channels inside a single `onUpdate` writer:

1. **Phase scale** — a proxy object `{ scale }` stepped through phases at trigger times (`PHASE_1_SCALE` at t=0 → `PHASE_2_SCALE` at `PHASE_2_AT` → `PHASE_3_SCALE` at `PHASE_3_AT`).
2. **Drift offset** — a continuous sine-based `translateX` / `translateY` (small amplitude, slow frequency) ADDED to the phase transform. X and Y run at slightly different frequencies (`DRIFT_FREQ_RATIO ≈ 1.3`) — equal frequencies produce a perfect diagonal that reads mechanical; ~1.3 gives an organic Lissajous.

## Recipe

```html
<div class="camera" id="camera">
  <div class="content">
    <div class="hero">{Brand}</div>
    <div class="tagline">{tagline}</div>
    <div class="cta">{ctaText}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.scene {
  overflow: hidden; /* REQUIRED — any phase scale < 1 exposes the content's edges */
  background: {sceneBgColor}; /* background on .scene, NOT .camera — a camera-borne
     background warps/translates with the transform and reveals the outer void */
}
.camera {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* off-center origin creates phase-to-phase drift */
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
const camera = document.getElementById("camera");

// Three-phase scale plan: pullback → focus → push.
const phase = { scale: PHASE_1_SCALE }; // Phase 1 is the initial value — no tween

// Phase 2 — settle to neutral focus
tl.to(phase, { scale: PHASE_2_SCALE, duration: PHASE_2_DUR, ease: PHASE_2_EASE }, PHASE_2_AT);

// Phase 3 — slow push-in for the climax
tl.to(phase, { scale: PHASE_3_SCALE, duration: PHASE_3_DUR, ease: PHASE_3_EASE }, PHASE_3_AT);

// Drift driver — continuous sine motion overlaid on the phase scale.
// The ONE writer of camera.style.transform.
const drift = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  drift,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * DRIFT_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION, // spans the whole composition
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const dx = Math.sin(drift.p) * DRIFT_AMP_X;
      const dy = Math.sin(drift.p * DRIFT_FREQ_RATIO) * DRIFT_AMP_Y;
      camera.style.transform = `scale(${phase.scale}) translate(${dx}px, ${dy}px)`;
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Content reveals happen INSIDE the camera frame (hero/tagline/cta beats).
```

## Phase Patterns

| Pattern             | Scale sequence (1 → 2 → 3)        | Feel                            | When to use                   |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Focus-in**        | back → neutral → slight push      | Approach → settle → slight push | Default product reveal        |
| **Dramatic reveal** | push → neutral → pull             | Wide → focus → settle back      | Hero shot with breathing room |
| **Steady push**     | neutral → slight push → more push | Gradual forward momentum        | Continuous narrative push     |
| **Bookend pull**    | neutral → strong push → neutral   | Settle → push → release         | CTA emphasis then release     |

## Variations

- **Phase trigger by content beat**: align a camera tween's start with a content tween's end (entry completes → push begins) rather than a fixed clock value.
- **Camera shake (panic / impact)**: a brief higher-amplitude, higher-frequency drift tween over a short window — same `drift` mechanism with `SHAKE_AMP` / `SHAKE_CYCLES` / `SHAKE_DUR` at `SHAKE_AT`.
- **Targeted zoom into an off-center element**: combine scale with counter-translation so the target lands at viewport center — divide the measured offset by the current scale before feeding it into the writer:

```js
const tRect = document.querySelector(".cta").getBoundingClientRect();
const offsetX = (STAGE_W / 2 - (tRect.left + tRect.width / 2)) / phase.scale;
const offsetY = (STAGE_H / 2 - (tRect.top + tRect.height / 2)) / phase.scale;
// then in onUpdate: translate(offsetX + dx, offsetY + dy)
```

| PHASE_2_AT / PHASE_2_DUR    | 0.3–1.0s / 1.0–1.8s                      | longer DUR = slower settle, more cinematic                                          |
| PHASE_3_AT / PHASE_3_DUR    | 2.0–4.0s / 1.0–2.0s                      | PHASE_3_AT ≥ PHASE_2_AT + PHASE_2_DUR or focus is preempted                         |

| DRIFT_FREQ_RATIO            | 1.2–1.5                                  | 1.0 = perfect diagonal (mechanical); ~1.3 = organic Lissajous                       |
| HERO_AT (etc.)              | after Phase-2 settle lands               | a hero fading in mid-pull-back feels like it's flying away                          |

## Critical Constraints

- **Camera wraps EVERYTHING in the scene** — a per-element camera creates parallax bugs and breaks the "one viewpoint" read.
- **One writer**: phase scale and drift compose inside the single drift `onUpdate`; nothing else touches `camera.style.transform`.
- **`overflow: hidden` on `.scene`** — required whenever any phase scale < 1.
- **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on `.camera`** — off-center origin creates unpredictable phase-to-phase drift.
- **Scene background on `.scene`, not `.camera`** — otherwise scaling/translating reveals the outer void.
- **Hero reveal starts AFTER the initial pull-back ease lands** — otherwise the headline feels like it's flying away.
